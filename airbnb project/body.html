        <p>Welcome to The Crown & Anchor, Richmond’s finest gathering spot for Greyhound fans. Our friendly neighborhood 
            pub is where us locals cheer, swear, laugh and cry at all of the trials and tribulations of football and 
            life. And now, I’m letting a few lucky guests stay overnight while I take the night off!</p>
            
            <p>Booking opens at 1 p.m. ET on March 21 for three stays on Oct. 23, 24 and 25. </p>

            <p>*These one-night stays are not a contest. Guests are responsible for their own travel 
                to and from Richmond.</p>

            <p><b>What you’ll do</b></p>
            <p>Situated in Richmond and right around the corner from Ted’s apartment, this traditional English 
                pub is a gathering place for football fans and locals alike, as well as the unofficial meeting 
                place of AFC Richmond players and coaches.
            </p>
            
            <p>Guests will experience what it’s like to stay overnight at the historic,
                 neighborhood pub for the first time, while putting themselves in the shoes of AFC Richmond coaches,
                  players and those pesky bar flies alike (they’re a real pain in my you-know-what!). 
            </p>

            <p>During their stay, pub guests will have the chance to channel their pub owner, including: </p>
            <p>- Enjoying pub fare while discussing their favorite moments from the show. </p>
            <p>- Cheering on the beloved local Richmond sports teams, decked out in AFC Richmond gear, of course. </p>
            <p>- Taking part in a competitive round of darts - whether left- or right-handed - or aiming for the
                 highest score on the pinball machine. </p>
            <p>- Taking a seat at Ted’s favorite table in the pub and challenging their fellow guests to a round of chess.</p>
            <p>- Showing off their karaoke skills with a rendition of their favorite song.</p>
            <p>- Trying those biscuits and enjoying them over some English tea (or as Ted calls it “hot brown water”).</p>
            <p><b>Other things to note</b></p>
            <p>I’ll welcome you virtually, but once guests arrive and check-in, our concierge will ensure a comfortable stay for our guests — including showing guests around and setting out and arranging meals. 
            </p>
            <p>Interested guests should note that the booking shall be conducted in strict adherence to local COVID-19 guidelines.</p>
            <p>Guests are responsible for their own travel to and from
                 Richmond. The pub listing is privately owned and operated by Fuller Smith and Turner.</p>
            <p>Season three of Ted Lasso premieres Wednesday, March 15.</p>
